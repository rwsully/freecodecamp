Image Embedding: Adding and controlling images using the <img> tag and attributes like alt for accessibility.

Links and Navigation: Implementing hyperlinks with the <a> tag.

Lists and Formatting: Structuring content with ordered/unordered lists and text formatting elements.

Best Practices: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable HTML.
